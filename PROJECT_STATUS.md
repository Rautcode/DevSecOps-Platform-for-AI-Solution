# DevSecOps Platform for AI Solutions

## Project Overview

A production-ready DevSecOps platform designed specifically for securing AI/ML workloads. This platform provides comprehensive security scanning, policy enforcement, monitoring, and governance capabilities for AI solutions.

## Status: Production Ready ‚úÖ

**Version:** 1.0  
**Environment:** Production-ready with development mode support

## Key Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Capabilities
- AI model vulnerability scanning and analysis
- Real-time security monitoring and threat detection  
- Policy-based access control with RBAC
- Automated compliance reporting (SOC2, ISO27001, GDPR, HIPAA)
- Secure credential management with HashiCorp Vault integration

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI with async support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production) / SQLite (development)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with middleware protection
- **Containerization**: Docker with docker-compose
- **Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry integration
- **Cloud**: Multi-cloud support (AWS, Azure)

### üìä Platform Components

#### Core Services
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT, RBAC, session management
- **Database Management**: SQLAlchemy ORM with async support
- **API Gateway**: RESTful API with comprehensive documentation
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and alerting
- **Policy Engine**: Configurable security policies and enforcement

#### Integrations
- **HashiCorp Vault**: Secure credential and secret management
- **AWS Security Hub**: Cloud security posture management
- **Azure Security Center**: Multi-cloud security integration
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and monitoring

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Docker (for production deployment)
- PostgreSQL (for production) or SQLite (for development)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd devsecops-platform-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Run the platform**
   ```bash
   python -m src.main
   ```

5. **Access the platform**
   - API: http://localhost:8000
   - Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Health Check: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## API Documentation

The platform provides comprehensive API documentation available at `/docs` when running. Key endpoints include:

- **Authentication**: `/api/v1/auth/*`
- **Security Scanning**: `/api/v1/security/*`
- **Policy Management**: `/api/v1/policies/*`
- **Monitoring**: `/api/v1/monitoring/*`
- **Health Checks**: `/api/v1/health`

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=src
```

## Security

- All secrets are managed through environment variables
- JWT tokens for authentication with configurable expiration
- Rate limiting and CORS protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive audit logging

## Monitoring & Observability

- Health check endpoints for all services
- Prometheus metrics export
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Security event monitoring and alerting
